"Who gets the cake first, Maria or Ebba the dog?"

This is a game made with simple HTML, Javascript and P5 functions.

It's a pretty straight forward run and jump game, with a five-layered parallax forest 
background bought on itch.io, here: https://tvdm1986.itch.io/parallax-forest-bg.

The games objective is to get to the cake before Ebba the dog. The dog is faster
than Maria, but Maria can pick up boosters (Pepsi Max cans) on the way, increasing
her speed.
