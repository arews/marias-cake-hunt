# marias-cake-hunt

"Who gets the cake first, Maria or Ebba the dog?"

The games objective is to get to the cake before Ebba the dog. The dog is faster than Maria, but Maria can pick up boosters (Pepsi Max cans) on the way, increasing her speed, and needs to avoid slowers (coca cola).

This is a game made with simple HTML, Javascript and P5 functions.

It's a pretty straight forward run and jump game, with a five-layered parallax forest background bought on itch.io, here: https://tvdm1986.itch.io/parallax-forest-bg.

I also had good use of this code snippet from Svenja, for animating images:

The font is a free font calles Press Start 2P, which you can find here: https://www.dafont.com/press-start-2p.font

The sounds are bougth on itch.io, and are called Yal's sound effect pack: https://yaru.itch.io/retro-sound-effect-pack-1/download/14T007OZcHbWyh1NU1PDFF1bLSjgCJlHDyn4WkOW

The background music for the start screen and the game are two free 8 bit songs found here: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/downloads-c/8-bit-music/6

All the styling is done directly in the js-files, using P5. No added css.
