# marias-cake-hunt

"Who gets the cake first, Maria or Ebba the dog?"

This is a game made with simple HTML, Javascript and P5 functions.

It's a pretty straight forward run and jump game, with a five-layered parallax forest
background bought on itch.io, here: https://tvdm1986.itch.io/parallax-forest-bg.

I also had good use of this code snippet from Svenja, for animating images:

The games objective is to get to the cake before Ebba the dog. The dog is faster
than Maria, but Maria can pick up boosters (Pepsi Max cans) on the way, increasing
her speed, and needs to avoid slowers (coca cola).
